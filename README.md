Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Tech Lead | Product Builder

I build **production-grade systems**, not demos.  
My focus is on **scalable architectures, clean frontend systems, reliable backend services, and DevOps that doesn’t collapse at 3am**.

---
## 🧠 What I Do

- Architect and build **SaaS products** from zero → production
- Lead frontend development with **React / Next.js / TypeScript**
- Design backend systems with **Node.js, Python, REST APIs**
- Ship with **Docker, CI/CD, Jenkins, cloud infrastructure**
- Integrate **AI tooling** pragmatically to increase delivery speed (not hype)
