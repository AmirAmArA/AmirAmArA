# 👋 Hi, I’m Amir

Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Tech Lead | Product Builder

I build **production-grade systems**, not demos.  
My focus is on **scalable architectures, clean frontend systems, reliable backend services, and DevOps that doesn’t collapse at 3am**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- Architect and build **SaaS products** from zero → production
- Lead frontend development with **React / Next.js / TypeScript**
- Design backend systems with **Node.js, Python, REST APIs**
- Ship with **Docker, CI/CD, Jenkins, cloud infrastructure**
- Integrate **AI tooling** pragmatically to increase delivery speed (not hype)

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React, Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- State management, performance optimization, accessibility

**Backend**
- Node.js, Express, Fastify
- Python (APIs, automation, AI workflows)
- RESTful architecture, authentication, role-based access

**Data**
- MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Schema design, migrations, data integrity

**DevOps**
- Docker, Docker Compose
- Jenkins (JCasC, pipelines)
- Nginx, Linux servers
- Cloud deployments (DigitalOcean / AWS-style setups)
